        "info": "Gas chromatography is a powerful analytical technique used to separate, identify and quantify components of mixtures that are in a gaseous or easily vaporized state. The carrier gas in this method plays a key role as it transports the analyte through the column. Among the popular carrier gases are helium and argon. In this article we will look at the characteristics, advantages and specifics of the gases offered by CO Labs for use in gas chromatography. Helium is an inert gas that is often used in gas chromatography due to its unique properties. It has a low density and high diffusivity, which provides high analysis speed and good resolution. Helium does not react chemically with analytes or column materials, which reduces the risk of nonspecific interactions and improves the reproducibility of results.The main advantages of using high-purity helium in the analysis are high analyte transfer rate through the column, good resolution (due to low viscosity and high thermal conductivity) and minimal risk of interaction with the analyte, providing clean peaks on the chromatogram. CO Lab Company always has a sufficient amount of pure product of 5.0 (99.999%) and 6.0 (99.9999%) purity grades in stock to meet the needs of the laboratories of the Republic. An alternative carrier gas is Argon. This gas, which is also inert, is used in gas chromatography, often in combination with methane (argon/methane) for flame ionization detection. Argon has a high density and a slower rate of analyte transport across the column than helium, which can affect analysis time and resolution.Argon is significantly less expensive than helium, suitable for certain types of detectors such as mass spectrometric type detectors or electron capture detectors. Argon provides a stable baseline and increased sensitivity for specific applications. CO Lab Company imports special purity argon (5.0 and 6.0 - 99.999% and 99.9999% purity) from plants in the Russian Federation. It has a constant stock of gases in the warehouse and accepts containers for exchange. Helium and argon carrier gases are used in gas chromatography due to their neutrality and chemical inertness. The choice between them depends on the specific tasks and conditions of the chromatographic analysis. The possibilities of their use make gas chromatography a versatile and powerful tool in analytical chemistry, enabling effective solutions for quality control, environmental monitoring and pharmaceutical research. CO Lab will supply the laboratory with any carrier gases depending on the production needs.",
